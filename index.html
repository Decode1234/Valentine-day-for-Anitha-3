                <h1 class="header_text">I bet you can't resist me, because let’s be honest, my skills are on another level! 😏</h1>
        <h1 class="header_text">Heyyy Anitha! I’d probably call you “Heyyy love” but… that might be a bit much, as of now? 😅</h1>
        <h1 class="header_text">You’re honestly so much fun to be around, and I've always wanted to go on a date with you—to see where it takes us. (Spoiler: I have a good feeling!)</h1>
        <h1 class="header_text">For some reason, I get this vibe that you’re craving some love, cuddles, deep conversations, maybe a little vacation getaway, and most importantly, success—for both of us! 🚀</h1>
        <h1 class="header_text">I didn’t want to disturb you too much because, as a man, my self-respect means everything to me. If I were to lose that, I wouldn’t even be able to call myself a man. Then, what respect would I get from the person I truly adore? </h1>          
        <h1 class="header_text">I tired being and thinking as your friend... and Yukkkk i didnt like just like your store work </h1>         
        <h1 class="header_text">And trust me, I’m not one to give up easily either… unless, of course, you block me everywhere. Then I guess I’ll just giveup. 😂😭</h1>
        <h1 class="header_text">Can we go out someday???</h1>
